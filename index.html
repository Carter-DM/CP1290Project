        <h1>From <i>Development by the CM</i> comes their latest title: Arcane.</h1>
        <p>
            Arcane is a simple one button fighting game. Inspired by the likes of Divekick, this simple fighting game
            consists of 2 mages that wield magical swords. With these swords they can attack their foes and achieve victory.
            While simple on design and content it rewards players who can predict and out think their opponent..

        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of the game is to out maneuver the other player and attack them while not getting attacked yourself.
            If two attacks connect with each other both mages are knocked backwards. If one mage strikes the other, they are awarded a point.
            First player to 3 point wins the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Button layout is laid out simply for the player. There is left and right inputs to control the player characters' movement.
            In addition, there is a jump button to let the players perform aerial combat or move above their opponent.
            The last button is the attack button. Hitting this button causes the player character to start their attack animation.
            Once the attack button is hit the mage will teleport their weapon forward, swing the sword out and then slowly bring their weapon back.
            This slow back-swing is very important to allow opponents to counter attack if they're quick enough to dodge.
